    <h2>debugging</h2>

        depending on the warning, you can see a lot of different ones from
        direct errors, to exceptions, and warnings
      </li>
      <li>strict mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5</li>
      <li>
        debugging is important because it helps you catch errors you might
        otherwise not notice, such as an age, it you assign it instead of
        checking a condition, it could comeback with the wrong desired results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Error objects can be created as constructor functions which will output
        an error or exception with the following code:
        <hr />
        <code>const error = new Error("Oops, something went wrong")</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        There are many different types of errors such as syntax erros, reference
        errors, type errors, internal erros and more!
      </li>

        Test Driven Development(TDD) is important to building and maintaining
        applications when they start to get large scale. They tend to be in a
        cycle of red-green-refactor.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use somthing like Jest with node to manage test driven
        development, which will help you test your code.
      </li>
    </ol>
