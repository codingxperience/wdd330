      <li>
        Inside the first section about additoinal functions they include
        information about using constants and passing those to functions, such
        as an object.
        <code>const clark = {name: 'clark'}</code>
        <code>hello(clark)</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Something that I thought was great was the immediate invoke of functions
        in this method below which allows to run a function immediately:
        <code
          >(function(){ const temp = "world"; console.log(`hello ${temp}`);
          })();
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        self contained blocks which are code blocks that can run independant of
        each other.
        <code
          >(function() { // block A const name = 'Block A'; console.log(`Hello
          from ${name}`); }()); (function() { // block B const name = 'Block B';
          console.log(`Hello from ${name}`); }());</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        I want to learn more about recursive functions where they invoke
        themselves till a condition is met.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another great tool is Ajax and fetch to get data from an API and you can
        pass it into an object and use that data or display it to the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use fetch in this manner:<br />
        <code>const url = "urlcode"; </code>
        <code
          ><br />fetch(url)<br />.then(res => res.json()).then(quiz =>
          {view.start.addEventListener("click", () =>
          game.start(quiz.questions), false);</code
        >
      </li>
    </ol>
