  <h1>Week 04 Notes</h1>
    <h3>forms</h3>
    <ol class="gradient-list">
      <li>forms must use the <code>form</code> tag</li>
      <li>
        forms are used in a lot of inputs from users, such as logins, search
        engines and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        forms can be used in functions and you can set an error if the form
        input value is a specific charater, like an X.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use event listeners and functions combined to take a value from
        the [0] (beginning) section of your form to get a value.
      </li>
      <li>
        forms can have values that if a string is empty the submit button is
        disabled via javascript
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Object-oriented Programming</h3>
    <ol class="gradient-list">
      <li>
        Object oriented programming is a method of separating the code into
        objects with properties and methods that you call.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are many different things you can do in OOP(object-oriented
        programming), such as encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Encapsulation is just exposing only important parts of programming like
        an on button.
      </li>
      <li>
        Polymorphism is like taking a class and morphing it for example to do
        something else or add to it. for example, you could have the animal
        class which extends to the dog class
      </li>
      <h3>Modern JavaScipt</h3>
      <ol class="gradient-list">
        <li>
          in modern javascript you can have libraries, MVC (Model View
          Controller), Jquery (a js library that adds to javascript) and much
          more.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can have stuff like imports from other code you make for example
        </li>
        <li>You can do stuff like templating for example {{ coolName }}</li>
        <li>You can see pi imported in the console</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
