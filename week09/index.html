        <li>
          The first item on the list was the window object, which is the BOM
          (Browswe Onject Model) which include a set of properties and
          information on the computer screen that you can manipulate and use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of these methods come from the window object. Every browswer has
          window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe.
        </li>
        <li>
          A method using the window is when you use the window.location.href
          like below:
          <pre>window.location.href = "https://google.com/"</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          You can get information such as window size by using the following
          code:
          <pre>window.screen.height</pre>
          <pre>window.screen.width</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          the next section was the html5 API section, which includes the data-
          attribute which embeds data.
        </li>
        <li>
          you can also use Localstorage which allows you to locally store
          information or data input by user or by the computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          geolocation is a great way to get current position, although the user
          has to approve this action by clicking and allowing the browser to
          collect that data.
